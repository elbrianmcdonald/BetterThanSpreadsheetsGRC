## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Access Application**: Navigate to http://localhost:5000
2. **Login**: Use Admin or GRC user credentials

- **Sample Data**: Visual example of properly formatted data
- **Important Notes**: Critical information about headers, data rows, defaults
- **File Validation**: Client and server-side file type checking
- **Overwrite Option**: Handle duplicate risk titles gracefully

### Robust Parsing Logic:
- **Currency Handling**: Automatic removal of $ signs and commas from ALE
- **Enum Validation**: Proper parsing of Risk Level and Treatment Strategy
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults for missing optional fields
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even if some rows fail
- **Row Skipping**: Automatically skips empty rows

### Business Logic Integration:
- **Risk Number Generation**: Automatic sequential numbering
- **Date Management**: Auto-set open and review dates
- **Status Assignment**: All uploaded risks start as "Open"
- **Owner Defaulting**: Sets "Unknown" if owner field is empty

## 📁 Files Created/Modified:
- `test_risks.xlsx` - Main test file with 8 sample risks
- `create_risk_test_excel.ps1` - PowerShell script to generate test file
- `/Views/Risks/Index.cshtml` - Added upload button with role-based visibility
- `RISK_UPLOAD_TEST_README.md` - This comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Feature Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND ENHANCED

The Risk Register Excel upload functionality was already implemented and is fully functional! I've enhanced it by:

1. **Added the missing upload button** to the Risk Register index page with proper role-based visibility
2. **Created comprehensive test data** with 8 realistic cybersecurity risk scenarios
3. **Verified all functionality** works as expected with proper validation and error handling

The upload system is more comprehensive than the Findings upload, featuring:
- More detailed upload instructions page
- Better error handling and validation
- Overwrite existing records option
- Comprehensive sample data and format documentation
- Robust currency and enum parsing

**Ready for immediate use by Admins and GRC users!**
